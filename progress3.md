# Progress Log — Person 3 (Frontend + Integration)

> Auto-updated after every prompt / workflow change.

---

## [2026-05-17] — Initial Setup

- Created workstream files for all 3 developers (person1.md, person2.md, person3.md)
- Created README.md with full project overview and integration contracts
- Renamed project from SOMA to **EternoMind** across all files
- Branch names assigned: `backend-core` (P1), `ai-pipeline` (P2), `frontend` (P3)
- Created `progress3.md` (this file) and `project_structure3.md`
- All files committed to `main` and pushed to `origin`
- **Person 3 branch `frontend` created and checked out**

### What is working
- Planning and documentation complete
- Branch `frontend` ready for implementation

### Next step
- Phase 1: Scaffold the React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui project

---

## [2026-05-17] — Phases 1, 2 & 3 Complete

### What was built
- **Phase 1**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript scaffold created. TailwindCSS 3.4.4 configured with full dark-mode CSS variables. Vite proxy set to forward `/api` → `http://localhost:8000`. `@` path alias configured.
- **Phase 2**: All three Zustand stores implemented:
  - `sessionStore` — userId, sessionId, accessToken, isAuthenticated
  - `chatStore` — messages, streaming state, pipeline step indicator
  - `metricsStore` — per-interaction token data array
- **Phase 3**: All UI components built and wired with stores (no backend needed):
  - `StreamingText` — renders content with blinking cursor when streaming
  - `MessageBubble` — user (blue/right) and assistant (dark/left) with metrics bar
  - `ChatInterface` — scrollable messages, pipeline step pill, error banner, input bar
  - `TokenSavingsChart` — Recharts LineChart (input=red, output=green, reference line at 720)
  - `PipelineStepsPanel` — 11 steps, idle/running/done states
  - `MetricsBar` — tokens, latency, model badge (orange=large, green=small), memory hits
- API layer scaffolded: `client.ts`, `auth.ts`, `sessions.ts`, `chat.ts` (POST SSE via ReadableStream), `metrics.ts`
- Hooks scaffolded: `useChat`, `useMetrics`, `useSSE`
- TypeScript: `tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors

### What is now working
- Full UI renders at `http://localhost:5173` (run `npm run dev` in `frontend/`)
- All components display correctly in mock/empty state
- Stores read/write correctly
- SSE parsing logic ready for real backend

### ⚠️ Manual steps required before Phase 4
See "Manual Integration Steps" section below.

### Next step
- Phase 4: Connect to Person 1's backend (branch: `backend-core`)
  - Requires Person 1 to complete their Phase 1-4 and confirm backend is running at `http://localhost:8000`
  - Requires demo user credentials from `seed_demo_user.py`
